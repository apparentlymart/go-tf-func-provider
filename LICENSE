NOTE: This codebase includes (in internal/tfplugin6) a copy of the protocol
buffers schema for the Terraform plugin protocol, which is not covered by
the following license, and is owned by HashiCorp. The Go package in that
directory is generated mechancially from the protocol buffers schema using
the protocol buffers compiler and associated gRPC plugin mentioned in the
generated comments.

The following license applies only to the other code in this package, which
is an original work implementing a client for the protocol. The author
interprets the use of the schema as fair use on the same grounds as
the United States Supreme Court decision on April 5, 2021 regarding the
use of the Java API specification in Android, but the author is not a
lawyer and this is not legal advice.
